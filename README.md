## 📜 What is this?

**Ascend** turns self-improvement into a game you can't hide from.

Every day you complete **quests** (workout, sleep, reading, deep work, skincare, and more), earn **XP**, build **streaks**, and climb from **E-Rank** all the way to **Monarch**. Nothing is stored as a vague "total": every action is logged, so you get a full **history** of how you've grown over weeks and months.

It started as a printable 29-page PDF protocol. This project brings it to life as a web app that **multiple people can use to level up together**.

> Inspired by the *"leveling up"* style of progression games. This is an independent, original project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by any anime, manga, or game franchise.

## 🎖 Rank Ladder

| Rank | Cumulative XP | What it represents |
|:---:|---:|---|
| **E** | 0 | Day 1. System initialized. |
| **D** | 1,500 | First stretch of consistency |
| **C** | 4,000 | First visible habit stability |
| **B** | 9,000 | Changes become visible to others |
| **A** | 18,000 | Habits run on autopilot |
| **S** | 30,000 | Sustained transformation |
| **SS** | 45,000 | Elite consistency |
| **SSS** | 65,000 | Mastery-level discipline |
| **Monarch** | 90,000 | It's no longer a routine. It's who you are. |

> ⚖️ Thresholds are data, not code, so they can be rebalanced without touching the app logic.

## 🗡 Sample Daily Quests

| Quest | XP |
|---|---:|
| Complete scheduled workout | +50 |
| Sleep 7.5+ hours | +50 |
| Deep work block completed | +40 |
| No social media for 3 hrs | +40 |
| Read 20+ pages | +30 |
| Hit protein target | +25 |
| Drink 3L+ water | +20 |
| Journal 3+ lines | +15 |

Quests, achievements, and boss battles all live in the database, seeded from [`prisma/seed.ts`](prisma/seed.ts).

## 🧠 How the XP engine works

Instead of storing `total_xp = 4200`, the app keeps an **append-only XP ledger**:

```
xp_events
  user_id | source (quest / boss / achievement) | amount | date
```

Total XP, rank, streaks, and weekly or monthly stats are all **derived** from this ledger. That gives you:

- 📊 Complete history and charts
- 🔁 Safe rebalancing: change quest values later without corrupting anyone's progress
- 🧾 An audit trail for every point earned

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase or Neon)
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth or Auth.js
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **Deploy:** Vercel
- **Delivery:** Installable **PWA**, so it works on desktop and mobile
